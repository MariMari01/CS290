5 Websites:
  1. Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/
    Youtube is a great website that I have watched update over the years. Something that might be a bit busy about it would be its side menu which is crowded with a lot of different options, I think putting them into             drop-down menus could potentially solve this.
  2. ebay: https://www.ebay.com/
    I like how the item categories on the top bar of the home page expand to show more specific search terms. I also like that it limits the amount of text that is shown in the title of an item to a fairly short length to        keep things from getting too overwhelming.
  3. Spotify:  https://open.spotify.com/
     Despite being designed mostly as a phone app I think the website is pretty nice, the player always being at the bottom makes pausing/unpausing and shifting through songs easy as you navigate through the rest of the           website.
  4. Wikipedia: https://www.wikipedia.org/
     I find Wikipedia very impressive for the sheer amount of information and articles within it, the somewhat bare-bones design of it also helps to avoid overwhelming the user with too much at once. I also really                appreciate that you can change the general appearance of the website from their settings menu if you don't like the default.
